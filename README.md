# Agent for RoomEnv-v2

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/776465360.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10876433)
## [RoomEnv-v2](https://github.com/humemai/room-env/blob/main/README-v2.md)

This repo introduces the gynmasium compatible room-env, where both the hidden states and
partial observations are represented as knowledge graphs. The agent is required to come
up with two policiesâ€”1. maze navigation (exploration) and 2. question answering. It's
highly recommended for the agent to have a long-term memory.
